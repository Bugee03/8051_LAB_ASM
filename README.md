# 8051_LAB_ASM

## 8051 (MCS-51) Microcontroller Laboratory Repository

This repository documents my structured learning and laboratory work on the **8051 microcontroller architecture** using both:

- 8051 Assembly (MCS-51 ISA)
- Embedded C (SDCC / Keil compatible)

The goal of this project is to build a strong low-level understanding of microcontroller systems — from instruction-level programming to hardware-level control.

# 🎯 Learning Objectives

✔ Understand 8051 architecture (register banks, RAM, SFRs)  
✔ Master addressing modes and instruction set  
✔ Work with stack, calls, interrupts  
✔ Control GPIO and bit-level operations  
✔ Implement timing and delay routines  
✔ Use UART serial communication  
✔ Write embedded C for 8051  
✔ Understand memory layout and compilation outputs  

This repository is part of my embedded systems engineering training.
